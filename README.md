ColabEd: Collaborative Lesson Planning for Inclusive Classrooms

ColabEd is a modular platform designed to support educators working in public, under-resourced, or low-connectivity environments. It helps teachers co-create inclusive, curriculum-aligned lesson plans, track classroom realities, and collaborate through shared pedagogical knowledge‚Äîeven offline.

Built like a mix between Notion, GitHub, and Moodle, but made for teachers, not techies.


What Problem Does It Solve?: Teachers in vulnerable school systems are burned out, isolated, and often asked to plan, teach, and evaluate without proper support or time. Planning is done alone. Evaluation is disconnected. Students with learning differences or emotional challenges are underserved‚Äînot from lack of care, but because the system is overloaded.
ColabEd responds to that pain point directly. It turns individual teacher effort into collective progress.

What Does It Do? Inclusive Planning Templates are built on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and aligned to national curriculum goals.

Live Lesson Tracking: Log what really happens (or doesn't) in class‚Äîwithout overloading the teacher.

Equity dashboard: Spot patterns, participation gaps, and adjust without needing data science skills.

Versionable Lessons: Like GitHub, but for pedagogical materials. Teachers can fork, remix, and improve content.

Offline-First, Low-Code Ready: Designed to work even in low-connectivity schools.

 Digital and Emotional Literacy Integration: No extra work. These skills are woven into the lesson creation process itself.

Current Status: Concept-stage with iterative prototyping in Tailwind CSS, Bubble.io, and lightweight Figma mockups.

Rooted in real-world classroom struggles‚Äîespecially those of overworked educators across Latin America.

 What‚Äôs Next? :MVP for offline-first curriculum planning, community of practice for feedback loops, pilots in collaboration with schools, NGOs, or Ministries
